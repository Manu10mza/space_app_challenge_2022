          <p>
            When they explored the Moon, NASAâ€™s Apollo astronauts left behind
            several instruments to collect geophysical data near each Apollo
            landing site. Our challenge was to develop an app that plots the
            seismic data these instruments transmitted back to Earth on an
            interactive 3-D globe.

          <p>
            The application was designed with the idea of scaling it and
            allowing the processing of new information brought by future
            missions in a simple way. This app could help future missions such
            as Artemis and hopefully the establishment of humanity on the Moon.
